# The configuration file needs to define the sources, 
# the channels and the sinks.
# Sources, channels and sinks are defined per a1, 
# in this case called 'a1'

# 为当前的agent设置各个组件的名称
a1.sources = r1
a1.channels = c1
a1.sinks = k1


# 定义source组件的类型及参数
a1.sources.r1.type = netcat
a1.sources.r1.bind = bd-server1
a1.sources.r1.port = 44444


#定义channels组件的类型及参数
#使用内存进行缓冲数据
a1.channels.c1.type = memory
#在channel中缓存events的最大数量，默认值是1000
a1.channels.c1.capacity = 1000
#source推送到channel 或者 sink从channel拉取 event 的最大数量
a1.channels.c1.transactionCapacity = 100


#定义sink的类型及参数
a1.sinks.k1.type = logger


#将channle连接对应的source和sink
a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1
